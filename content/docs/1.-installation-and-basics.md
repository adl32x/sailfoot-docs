## Running

Run the binary. `sf`

## Basics

Sailfoot is built around simple concepts instead of fancy configuration. Your start configuration goes into `start.txt` and everything else (keywords and test case configuration) inside the directory `keywords/`.

You can also use the `-file` flag to change the location of your start script.

## Hello world

start.txt:
```
navigate https://url_to_hello_world

has_text 'Hello world!'
```

Run `sf`.
